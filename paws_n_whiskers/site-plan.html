			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>1. When the home page loads, a random animal that is currently up for adoption will dynamically be inserted into the main page, with its photo and 
				accompanying details.<br><br> 2. There will be a search box to allow users to search for their animal of choice and have the results dynamically displayed on the page.<br><br> 
				3. On the child page, in the adoption application, there will be an additional question dynamically inserted into the form, which is dependent upon the user's 
				response to the previous question.<br><br> 4. When the application confirmation is returned, it will be personalized with the applicant's name, the total number of members in

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>The home page will have this article about pet care: Summer has arrived, but there are 
				a few things that you should consider, if you're heading to the lake with your dog. Some 
				dogs are natural-born swimmers, but others may not like water at all. If you want everyone 
				to have a great experience, there are some things that you can do to help your dog. If in 
				doubt about your pet's ability near water, then we recommend getting them a dog life-jacket. 
				<br><br>
				Introduce them slowly into small bodies of water, perhaps a kiddie pool with a few toys. 
				Don't forget to keep some treats on hand as a reward. Keep them leashed to maintain their 
				safety and allow them to enter the water slowly, at their own pace. If they're hesitant, take 
				a few steps into the water yourself to show them that it's not so scary. Never toss, push, 
				or pull your dog into the water, as it is dangerous and likely to increase their fear. A little 
				patience goes a long way and before you know it, they'll be begging YOU to go to the beach!    
			</p> 
			<p> The links and data for the animals that will be displayed on the home page are listed 
				below. I have images in my "images" folder for all 9 animals. This data will be kept in my 
				paws.mjs file. <br><br>

			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>Page 2 will list these considerations for the applicant before adopting:  
				1. Pets are a lifetime committment; most cats/dogs/rabbits live 10-16 years. Are you ready? 
				2. Does your household have children or elderly members that your pet needs to get along with? 
				3. Are you ready to deal with pet hair on a daily basis? There will be shedding. 
				4. Is anyone in your household allergic to animals? 
				5. Are you ready for the financial committment? Pets need food, grooming, and vet care.
				6. Who will carry the responsibility for your pet's care? Will they be home during the day?
				7. Do you have the equipment? All adopted cats/rabbits must be transported home in a secure 
				carrier. Dogs must be leashed and collared.     
				<br><br>
				This is the information that will appear in the Adoption Fees section: 
				The adoption fee includes up-to-date vaccinations, micro-chipping, flea/worm 
				treatments, and spaying/neutering. Fees: Cats-$200; Dogs-$450; Rabbits-$100; 
				Senior Animals (6 yrs+): Cats-$75; Senior Dogs-$150; Senior Rabbits-$35;    
				<br><br>
				The application form will ask for these pieces of information: first name, last name, email, 
				phone number, address, if they live in a house or apartment (dynamically inserted questions here:
				if house-do they have a fenced yard, if apt.-Do they have their landlord's approval), number of 
				children in the household, number of adults in the household, occupation, type of pet they want, 
				and if there are other pets in the household. 
			</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				The home page wireframes show what the page will look like when it's first rendered. 
				When the dynamic search results are returned, they will be displayed one after another,
				under the search bar and before the pet care section. To make it easier to access the 
				pet care section. I've put a link in the Nav that will take the user straight to the 
				pet care information, so it doesn't get over-looked below the results.  
			</p>

			<img src="images/p_w_wireframe_largescreen_home.JPG" alt="large screen home page wireframe" class="wireframe" />
			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>
				I couldn't fit all the questions on the child page wireframe, so you can't see what the 
				the questions are that will trigger the dynamic content. The user will be asked if they 
				live in an apartment or house, that is where another question will be dynamically inserted 
				depending on their answer. 
				<br><br>
				Also, one of the questions on the application is the number of 
				children and the number of adults living in the house. Those two inputs will be retrieved and 
				added together using the reduce() method and then the total will be dynamically inserted 
				into the confirmation for the form submission.
